# Max Nigri

Logic Design Engineer | ASIC & FPGA Specialist

## About Me

I am **Max Nigri**, Seasoned technologist and entrepreneur with extensive experience across multiple domains of the chip design industry. Strong focus on accelerating cloud workloads through domain-specific architecture (DSA), achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in price-performance.Possess deep expertise across the entire technology stack—from software APIs down to logic gates. Skilled in workload analysis, performance modeling, architectural design, data structure definition, hardware/software interface design, RTL development, and backend implementation

This profile serves as the hub for my open-source contributions and technical projects.

## Featured Projects
### 🚀 [Logic Simulation Engine (2015)](https://github.com/max-nigri/logic-simulation-engine)
This repository represents the results of two years of intense development, creating the first logic simulator based on a dedicated hardware architecture rather than standard software.

### 🚀 [Jpeg Encoder Engine (2006)](https://github.com/max-nigri/jpeg_project_2006).
This repository documents a hardware design project developed as part of the Advanced Logic Design course I taught at the Computer Engineering Department, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, from 2006 to 2017

### 🚀 [SCS16 Core (2008)](https://github.com/max-nigri/scs16-core-2008)
SCS16 is a microcontroller core featuring a 16-bit datapath and single-cycle instruction execution.
Development of the SCS16 architecture began in 2003, and this repository makes the 2008 version publicly available for the first time.
